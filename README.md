# Rivet Next Components
Experimental components for the next version of Rivet.

## About
This repo uses a static site generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) to build the HTML for these components.
The compiled HTML can be found in the `docs` folder. Compiled CSS and JavaScript is in the `dist` folder.
